Dataset Information – DeepElecForecast Project

The dataset used in this project was obtained for academic purposes / self-collected
and is not publicly redistributable.

Due to file size limitations and data usage restrictions, the full dataset is not
included in this repository.

To reproduce this project:
- Use any electricity demand time series dataset
- Ensure it follows the column format described in the README
- Place the dataset at the following path:

data/raw/electricity.csv

A small sample dataset is included in this folder to demonstrate the expected data format.

src/data_loader.py
import os
import pandas as pd

def load_data():
    data_path = "data/raw/electricity.csv"

    if not os.path.exists(data_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError("Dataset not found. Please place the dataset at "
            "'data/raw/electricity.csv' as described in DATASET_INFO.txt." )

    return pd.read_csv(data_path)
